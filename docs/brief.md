# Project Brief: Local Business Intelligence Platform

## Executive Summary

This project will create a specialized, personal business intelligence tool for aggregating, analyzing, and visualizing data on local businesses. The primary problem it solves is the inefficient and manual process of gathering scattered data for personal competitive analysis and deal sourcing. The platform will feature a dashboard with advanced filtering and an integrated map, empowering the user to rapidly identify high-quality businesses for potential acquisition, evaluate competitor advertising strategies, and benchmark a company's performance against its local market. The initial scope will be the restoration business sector in Texas, with a long-term goal of building a scalable platform to support other sectors and geographies for personal research.

## Problem Statement

For an individual conducting deal sourcing and competitive intelligence on local service-based businesses, the current process for gathering and analyzing data is manual, inefficient, and prone to error. Critical, up-to-date data points—such as contact and owner information, customer reviews and ratings, structured industry codes (NAICS), founding dates, and website status—are scattered across disparate sources including general search engines, multiple review platforms, and state-level government websites.

This fragmentation forces a time-consuming workflow of manual searching and data collation, preventing the deeper analysis needed to accurately gauge business quality and performance. Furthermore, there is no straightforward way to layer this business data with geographic and demographic information (e.g., zip code data), making it difficult to identify underserved markets or strategic gaps. Existing solutions are not tailored for this specific, analysis-driven workflow, leaving a need for a tool that can structure this data for rapid decision-making.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a custom-built, personal business intelligence platform that automates the aggregation and analysis of local business data. The core approach involves ingesting data from a variety of online sources (via APIs and direct scraping) into a single, structured database. This centralized data will then be presented to the user through a clean, functional dashboard.

The key features of the platform will be powerful, multi-variable filtering (e.g., by NAICS code, customer rating, location) and an integrated map for geographic visualization and analysis. Unlike commercial enterprise platforms, this tool will be specifically tailored to the user's deal sourcing and competitive intelligence workflow. It will succeed by prioritizing functional data access and analysis over polished aesthetics in the MVP and by being purpose-built to answer the user's specific research questions.

The high-level vision is to develop a scalable platform, initially proven with the Texas restoration business sector, that can be expanded to cover other business sectors and geographies, eventually incorporating sophisticated data layers like zip code demographics for advanced market gap analysis.

## Target Users

#### Primary User Segment: The Analyst & Deal Sourcer
* **Profile:** An individual strategist conducting market analysis and deal sourcing focused on local, service-based businesses. This user is hands-on with research and requires efficient tools to support data-driven decisions for personal investment and competitive intelligence.
* **Current Behaviors and Workflows:** The user currently relies on a manual process involving multiple browser tabs, search engines, and spreadsheets to collate fragmented data from various online sources. This process is inefficient and lacks the ability to perform dynamic filtering or geographic analysis.
* **Specific Needs and Pain Points:** The primary need is for a centralized and up-to-date source of structured business data (including contact info, reviews, NAICS codes, etc.). The core pain point is the sheer amount of time and effort wasted on manual data gathering, which delays insights and can lead to missed opportunities.
* **Goals:** To use the tool to rapidly identify high-quality businesses meeting specific criteria, evaluate competitor strategies, and benchmark companies to support personal investment and research objectives.

---

## Goals & Success Metrics

#### Business Objectives
* To reduce the time required to identify and collate data for 10 target businesses in a given market from an estimated 4+ hours to under 30 minutes by the completion of the MVP.
* To enable the analysis of a broader set of potential businesses, increasing the quantity of qualified targets reviewed per week.

#### User Success Metrics
* The tool consistently replaces the previous manual workflow for all new research tasks.
* The user can confidently identify at least 5 new, qualified business targets per week that would likely have been missed using the manual process.
* The user feels a high degree of confidence in the accuracy and timeliness of the aggregated data.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* **Time-to-Insight:** The average time from initiating a search to having a complete, actionable data profile for a single business. **Target: < 5 minutes.**
* **Data Coverage Rate:** The percentage of businesses in a given search for which all core data points (reviews, website, NAICS, etc.) are successfully retrieved. **Target: > 90%.**
* **Relevant Target Rate:** The percentage of businesses identified through filtering that meet the user's subjective quality criteria upon manual review. **Target: > 80%.**

## MVP Scope

#### Core Features (Must Have)
* **Data Aggregation:** The system must be able to pull and store data for **restoration businesses located in Texas**.
* **Core Data Points:** The following data points must be collected: reviews, address/city, star rating, website link, year started, contact information, owner information, and NAICS codes.
* **Filtering:** A functional interface to filter the list of businesses by the core data points.
* **List View:** A simple table or list view to display the filtered businesses and their associated data.
* **Map Visualization:** A basic but functional map view that shows the geographic location of the filtered businesses.

#### Out of Scope for MVP
* **National Scale:** Data aggregation will be limited to Texas only.
* **Other Business Sectors:** The system will only support the "restoration business" sector.
* **Advanced Data:** Automated revenue projections and other secondary data from state websites are not included.
* **Demographic Data Layering:** Layering zip code and demographic data for market gap analysis is a post-MVP feature.
* **High-Polish UI:** The focus is on function over form; advanced styling and a "pretty" interface are not initial requirements.
* **User Accounts & Authentication:** As a personal tool, a complex login system is not required for the MVP.

#### MVP Success Criteria
* The MVP is successful if it meets the primary business objective: reducing the time to research 10 businesses from 4+ hours to under 30 minutes.
* The MVP is successful if the core data points are successfully retrieved for over 90% of businesses in a target search (as defined by the Data Coverage Rate KPI).
* The MVP successfully replaces the user's manual spreadsheet-based workflow for this specific research task.

## Post-MVP Vision

#### Phase 2 Features
* **Demographic Data Layering:** Integrate and layer zip code and demographic data to enable advanced market gap analysis and identify underserved areas.
* **Advanced Analytics & Benchmarking:** Introduce features to directly compare and benchmark multiple businesses against each other on key metrics.
* **UI/UX Refinement:** Invest in a higher-polish user interface and more sophisticated data visualizations.

#### Long-term Vision
* **National Scale:** Expand the data aggregation system to cover all 50 states, becoming a comprehensive tool for local business intelligence across the entire U.S.
* **Multi-Sector Support:** Broaden the platform's capabilities to include various other local service sectors beyond the initial focus on restoration businesses.

#### Expansion Opportunities
* **Advanced Data Integration:** Incorporate more complex data points, such as revenue projections, by integrating with advanced financial or state-level data sources.
* **Workflow Automation:** Introduce features like automated report generation or alerts that trigger when a business meeting specific criteria is identified.

## Technical Considerations

#### Platform Requirements
* **Target Platforms:** A responsive web application with a primary focus on desktop use. Mobile responsiveness is a secondary goal but not a strict MVP requirement.
* **Browser/OS Support:** Latest versions of modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
* **Performance Requirements:** Filter and map updates should render in under 2 seconds.

#### Technology Preferences
* **Frontend:** React
* **Backend:** Python
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Vercel (or a similar platform focused on ease of use).

#### Architecture Considerations
* **Repository Structure:** A Monorepo containing both frontend and backend code is preferred for simplified management.
* **Service Architecture:** A Monolith approach for the backend is suitable for the MVP, given it's a solo project.
* **Integration Requirements:** The application will require integration with various external APIs for data gathering.
* **Security/Compliance:** Standard security practices for a personal tool will be followed, with a focus on protecting external API keys.

## Constraints & Assumptions

#### Constraints
* **Budget:** As a personal project, the budget is limited. While higher initial API costs are acceptable for MVP development speed, long-term operational costs should be kept low.
* **Timeline:** The goal is to develop a functional MVP in a timely manner to begin using the tool and validating its usefulness.
* **Resources:** Development will be performed by AI agents under the direct guidance of the user, who is the sole stakeholder.
* **Technical:** The project must be implemented using the selected technology stack (React, Python, PostgreSQL) and hosting platform (Vercel).

#### Key Assumptions
* **Data Availability:** We assume the required data points (reviews, NAICS, owner info, etc.) are programmatically accessible via public APIs or can be reliably scraped from public websites.
* **API Access:** We assume any necessary API keys (e.g., for mapping or business data) can be obtained and will function for this personal use case within acceptable cost limits for the MVP.
* **MVP Sufficiency:** We assume the features defined in the MVP scope will be sufficient to replace the user's current manual workflow and provide a significant improvement in efficiency.

## Risks & Open Questions

#### Key Risks
* **Data Scraping Reliability:** The primary data acquisition method may involve web scraping, which is inherently brittle. Target websites can change their structure or implement anti-scraping measures at any time, which would break the data pipeline.
* **Data Accuracy and Normalization:** Data from various sources will be inconsistent and may be out-of-date. Ensuring data quality and normalizing it into a consistent schema will be a significant technical challenge.
* **API Limitations and Costs:** While initial costs are acceptable for the MVP, scaling the use of commercial APIs could become prohibitively expensive if the tool's usage grows significantly over time.
* **MVP Scope Creep:** As a personal project with many potential features, there is a significant risk of adding "just one more feature," which could delay the completion of a core, functional MVP.

#### Open Questions
* What are the specific terms of service for each target data source, and do they prohibit automated data gathering for this personal use case?
* Which specific APIs (e.g., Google Places, Yelp, state business registries) provide the best balance of data coverage, accuracy, and cost for the MVP?
* What is the most effective data refresh strategy to keep the information up-to-date without incurring excessive costs or hitting API limits?

#### Areas Needing Further Research
* A technical investigation into the anti-scraping technologies used by primary target websites.
* A comparative analysis of third-party data APIs to determine the optimal choice for the MVP.
* A legal review of the terms of service for any website that will be scraped.
