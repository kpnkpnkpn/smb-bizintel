# Local Business Intelligence Platform UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the Local Business Intelligence Platform's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

#### Overall UX Goals & Principles
* **Overall UX Vision:** A data-centric, highly functional interface that prioritizes speed and clarity over aesthetic complexity.
* **Core Principles:**
    * **Clarity over cleverness** - Prioritize clear communication.
    * **Progressive disclosure** - Show only what's needed, when it's needed.
    * **Consistent patterns** - Use familiar UI patterns.
    * **Immediate feedback** - Every action should have a clear response.
    * **Accessible by default** - Design for all users from the start.

## Information Architecture (IA)

#### Site Map / Screen Inventory
This diagram shows the relationship between the core components of the single-page dashboard.

    C --> C1[List View]
    C --> C2[Map View]


## User Flows

#### Filtering and Analyzing Businesses
* **User Goal:** To apply a specific set of criteria to the full dataset of businesses and view the results in both a list and a map format, and then to be able to "dive deeper" into any specific business for detailed analysis.
* **Entry Points:** The user lands directly on the Main Dashboard.
* **Success Criteria:** The user successfully isolates a subset of businesses and can select an individual business from the results to view all of its aggregated supplementary data.
* **Key Interaction:** **Drill-Down View:** Clicking on a business in either the list or the map will reveal a detailed view or panel with all supplementary information for that specific business.

##### Flow Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[User lands on Dashboard];
    B --> C[User interacts with Filter Panel];
    C --> D[User clicks 'Apply Filters'];
    D --> E[System shows Loading State & fetches data];
    E --> F{Data returned?};
    F -- Yes --> G[List & Map Views are populated with results];
    F -- No / Error --> H[Display Error Message];
    G --> I[User Clicks a Row in List];
    G --> J[User Clicks a Pin on Map];
    I --> K[System Displays Business Detail Panel];
    J --> K;
    K --> G;

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
No Results Found: If the filter criteria return zero businesses, the application will display a clear 'No results found' message.

API Error: If the backend API call fails, a user-friendly error message will be displayed.

Slow Load Time: A visible loading indicator will be displayed during any data fetch.

## Wireframes & Mockups
Primary Design Files
For the MVP, we will not be using a separate design tool. Instead, we will define the layout conceptually in this document to guide development, prioritizing function over form.

## Key Screen Layouts: Main Dashboard
Purpose: To provide a unified interface for filtering, viewing, and drilling down into business data.

Conceptual Layout: A two-column layout is recommended for desktop.

Left Column (Filter Panel): A persistent panel on the left side of the screen, taking up roughly 25-30% of the viewport width. It will contain all the filtering controls.

Right Column (Content Area): The main area on the right, taking up the remaining 70-75% of the width.

At the top of this area, a View Toggle will allow the user to switch between "List" and "Map" views.

The rest of the area will be the Results Display, showing either the data table or the interactive map.

Interaction Notes: When a user selects a business from the list or map, a Detail Panel can slide in or appear over the Content Area to display the supplementary information.

## Component Library / Design System

#### Design System Approach
To ensure a clean, consistent, and accessible UI without the overhead of building a custom design system, we will use a pre-built React component library. This will accelerate development and provide a professional look and feel for the MVP. The choice of a specific library (e.g., MUI, Chakra UI, Mantine) will be a technical decision made during the architecture phase.

#### Core Components
Based on our defined layout and user flow, we will need the following core components from the library:
* **Inputs & Controls:**
    * Text Input (for text search)
    * Dropdown / Select (for categories)
    * Button (for "Apply Filters")
* **Layout & Display:**
    * Tabs or Segmented Control (to toggle between List/Map)
    * Table (to display business results)
    * Card or Drawer (for the Business Detail Panel)
* **Feedback:**
    * Loading Spinner
    * Alert Message (for errors or no results)
* **Map Specific:**
    * Map Marker / Pin
    * Map Popup

## Branding & Style Guide

#### Visual Identity
* **Brand Guidelines:** No existing brand guidelines will be used. The visual identity will be clean, minimalist, and data-focused, prioritizing usability.

#### Color Palette
| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Primary | `#3B82F6` (Blue) | Interactive elements, buttons, links |
| Secondary | `#6B7280` (Gray) | Secondary text, borders |
| Success | `#10B981` (Green) | Positive feedback, confirmations |
| Warning | `#F59E0B` (Amber) | Cautions, important notices |
| Error | `#EF4444` (Red) | Errors, destructive actions |
| Neutral | Various shades | Text, backgrounds, panels |

#### Typography
* **Primary Font Family:** System UI font stack (San Francisco on Apple devices, Segoe UI on Windows, Roboto on Android/ChromeOS). This ensures a native feel and fast performance.
* **Monospace Font Family:** A standard system monospace font (e.g., Menlo, Consolas) for any raw data snippets.
* **Type Scale:** A simple and clear scale will be used for headings and body text to ensure readability and hierarchy.

#### Iconography
* **Icon Library:** A comprehensive, open-source icon library like Heroicons or Feather Icons will be used for clarity and consistency.

#### Spacing & Layout
* **Grid System:** A standard 12-column grid system will be used for overall page layout.
* **Spacing Scale:** An 8px baseline grid system will be used for consistent margins, padding, and spacing between elements.

## Accessibility Requirements

* **Compliance Target:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
* **Key Requirements:** To meet this standard, we will ensure all functionality is navigable via keyboard, all interactive elements have clear focus states, color contrast ratios are sufficient, and ARIA attributes are used where needed for screen reader support.
* **Testing Strategy:** We will use a combination of automated scans and manual keyboard navigation checks.

---

## Responsiveness Strategy

* **Breakpoints:** We will use standard breakpoints for mobile (< 768px), tablet (768px - 1024px), and desktop (> 1024px).
* **Adaptation Patterns:** The primary two-column desktop layout will gracefully collapse to a single-column layout on mobile devices. The Filter Panel may be hidden behind a toggle button on smaller screens to maximize content visibility.

---

## Animation & Micro-interactions

* **Motion Principles:** Animations will be used sparingly and purposefully to provide feedback (e.g., on loading states) and guide the user's attention, without sacrificing performance.

---

## Performance Considerations

* **Performance Goals:** We will adhere to the goal of all filter and map updates rendering in under 2 seconds. We will also target a First Contentful Paint (FCP) of under 2.5 seconds.
* **Design Strategies:** This will be achieved through standard web performance best practices like code splitting and optimizing data payloads.

## Next Steps

* **Immediate Actions:**
    1.  Finalize and save this UI/UX Specification to `docs/front-end-spec.md`.
    2.  Engage the Architect (`architect`) agent to begin creating the detailed Frontend Architecture document, using this spec as the primary input.
