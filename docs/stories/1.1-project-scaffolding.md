# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Initial Deployment

## Status
- Approved

## Story
**As a** platform owner,
**I want** a complete project structure with a frontend and backend, deployed to Vercel,
**so that** I have a working foundation to build features on.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A monorepo is initialized to hold the project's code.
2. A basic React application is created in the `apps/frontend` directory.
3. A basic Python application is created in the `apps/backend` directory.
4. A PostgreSQL database is provisioned and connected to the backend application.
5. The project is successfully deployed to Vercel, displaying a simple placeholder page.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Initialize Monorepo (AC: #1)**
  - [ ] Initialize a new Git repository.
  - [ ] Initialize a Turborepo project within the repository.
  - [ ] Configure `package.json` workspaces for `apps/*` and `packages/*`.

- [ ] **Task 2: Scaffold Frontend Application (AC: #2)**
  - [ ] Use Vite to create a new React + TypeScript application in `apps/frontend`.
  - [ ] Install core frontend dependencies as specified in the architecture document (e.g., Mantine, Zustand, Tailwind CSS).
  - [ ] Create a simple placeholder component to display "Hello World".

- [ ] **Task 3: Scaffold Backend Application (AC: #3)**
  - [ ] Create the directory structure for the Python app in `apps/backend`.
  - [ ] Initialize a `requirements.txt` file with FastAPI and other necessary backend dependencies.
  - [ ] Create a basic FastAPI application in `apps/backend/api/index.py` with a single root endpoint that returns a health check message.

- [ ] **Task 4: Set up Database (AC: #4)**
  - [ ] Provision a new PostgreSQL database on a managed service (e.g., Vercel Postgres, Neon).
  - [ ] Create a `.env.example` file in `apps/backend` for the `DATABASE_URL`.
  - [ ] Add code to the FastAPI application to establish a connection to the database.

- [ ] **Task 5: Configure for Vercel Deployment (AC: #5)**
  - [ ] Create a `vercel.json` file at the root to configure the build outputs and serverless function locations for both the frontend and backend.
  - [ ] Connect the Git repository to a new Vercel project.
  - [ ] Configure the necessary environment variables (like `DATABASE_URL`) in the Vercel project settings.
  - [ ] Trigger a deployment and verify that the placeholder page is live.

## Dev Notes
This story is foundational. All work must adhere to the specifications in the Fullstack Architecture Document.

**Project Structure to Create:**
```plaintext
/
├── apps/
│   ├── frontend/
│   └── backend/
├── packages/
│   ├── shared-types/
│   └── config/
├── package.json
├── turbo.json
└── vercel.json

#### Key Technologies:
* **Monorepo:** Turborepo
* **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Mantine, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Hosting:** Vercel

#### Testing Standards:
For this story, the primary goal is successful deployment. Add a simple health-check test for the backend API endpoint and a basic rendering test for the frontend placeholder component.

#### Coding Standards:
Set up initial ESLint (for frontend) and Ruff (for backend) configurations in the packages/config directory.
