# Story 1.5: Frontend Data Display

## Status
- Done

## Story
**As a user,**
**I want** to see the list of aggregated businesses in a simple table view,
**so that** I can verify the data is being collected.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The React frontend calls the `/api/businesses` endpoint on page load.
2. The retrieved list of businesses is displayed in a simple, unstyled table.
3. The table correctly shows all the core data points for each business retrieved from the backend.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Import the shared `Business` type from `packages/shared-types/index.ts` (AC: 3) [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]
- [ ] Implement a React component that fetches data from `/api/businesses` on page load (AC: 1) [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]
  - [ ] Use `fetch` or a similar method to call the endpoint
  - [ ] Handle API key authentication if required (for local dev, may be disabled)
  - [ ] Handle loading and error states [Source: front-end-spec.md#user-flows]
- [ ] Render the list of businesses in a table, displaying all fields from the `Business` type (AC: 2, 3) [Source: shared-types/index.ts]
- [ ] Display a clear message if no businesses are returned [Source: front-end-spec.md#edge-cases--error-handling]
- [ ] Display a user-friendly error message if the API call fails [Source: front-end-spec.md#edge-cases--error-handling]
- [ ] Add a loading indicator while fetching data [Source: front-end-spec.md#user-flows]
- [ ] Write a unit/component test for the table rendering [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- [ ] Write a test for the loading and error states [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Backend API endpoint `/api/businesses` is complete, returns all businesses in the correct format, and is secured with API key authentication. [Source: stories/1.4-backend-api-endpoint-for-businesses.md#dev-agent-record]
- Shared `Business` type is defined in `packages/shared-types/index.ts` and must be used for type safety. [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]

### Data Models
- Use the `Business` interface from `packages/shared-types/index.ts` for all frontend data handling. [Source: architecture.md#data-models]
- All fields in the table should match the `Business` type (id, name, address, city, state, zipCode, latitude, longitude, website, phoneNumber, ownerName, yearStarted, starRating, reviewCount, naicsCode, createdAt, updatedAt).

### API Specifications
- Endpoint: `/api/businesses` (GET)
- Returns: Array of `Business` objects in JSON format [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]
- Error responses follow the standardized format: `{ "detail": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }` [Source: architecture.md#error-handling-strategy]
- API key authentication may be required via `X-API-Key` header [Source: architecture.md#security-and-performance]

### Component Specifications
- Table should be simple and unstyled for MVP [Source: prd.md#story-1-5-frontend-data-display]
- Use a loading spinner and error alert as per UI/UX spec [Source: front-end-spec.md#feedback]
- Display all core data points for each business [Source: shared-types/index.ts]

### File Locations
- Main component: `apps/frontend/src/` (e.g., `BusinessTable.tsx`)
- Shared types: `packages/shared-types/index.ts`
- Tests: `apps/frontend/src/__tests__/`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit/component test for table rendering with sample data [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Test for loading and error states [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Use Vitest and React Testing Library [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- Must use the shared `Business` type for all data [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]
- Must handle API errors and display user-friendly messages [Source: architecture.md#error-handling-strategy]
- Must show a loading indicator while fetching data [Source: front-end-spec.md#user-flows]

## Testing
- Test file location: `apps/frontend/src/__tests__/BusinessTable.test.tsx`
- Test standards: Use Vitest and React Testing Library
- Testing frameworks and patterns: Arrange-Act-Assert, mock API responses
- Specific requirements: Test table rendering, loading, error, and empty states

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-07-25
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation for Story 1.5 is clean, idiomatic, and follows modern React and TypeScript best practices. The `BusinessTable` component:
- Correctly imports and uses the shared `Business` type for type safety.
- Fetches data from `/api/businesses` on mount, with proper loading and error handling.
- Renders all required fields in a simple, unstyled table as specified.
- Handles empty states and API errors with user-friendly messages.
- Is fully integrated into the main app and rendered at the root.
- Is covered by comprehensive unit/component tests using Vitest and React Testing Library, including tests for loading, error, and empty states.

### Refactoring Performed
No significant refactoring was required. The code is already well-structured and adheres to the architectural and coding standards. Minor suggestions for future improvement (not blocking):
- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/BusinessTable.tsx`
  - **Change**: None required at this time.
  - **Why**: The code is clear, concise, and meets all requirements.
  - **How**: N/A

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ (Shared types, error handling, and structure all conform)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Files are in correct locations per architecture)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (Tests are comprehensive and follow Arrange-Act-Assert)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (All acceptance criteria are fully implemented)

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Used shared `Business` type for all data handling
- [x] Implemented loading, error, and empty states
- [x] Comprehensive unit/component tests for all states
- [ ] Consider extracting table header fields to a constant for maintainability
- [ ] Add accessibility enhancements (e.g., ARIA roles for table, improved focus management)
- [ ] Add integration/E2E test for user flow (optional for MVP)

### Security Review
- No sensitive data is exposed in the frontend.
- API key handling is mentioned in the code and story, but for local dev is not enforced.
- No security issues found in this implementation.

### Performance Considerations
- The table is unstyled and renders efficiently.
- No performance bottlenecks identified for the MVP scale.

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Done
- All tasks and subtasks completed as specified.
- BusinessTable component fetches `/api/businesses` on load, uses the shared `Business` type, and displays all fields in a table.
- Handles loading, error, and empty states per requirements.
- All code is type-safe and follows project architecture standards.

### Testing & Validation
- Unit/component tests cover table rendering, loading, error, and empty states.
- All tests pass using Vitest and React Testing Library with jest-dom matchers.
- Test setup is in `src/setupTests.ts` and configured in `vite.config.ts`.
