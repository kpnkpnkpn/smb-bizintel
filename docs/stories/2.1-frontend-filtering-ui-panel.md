# Story 2.1: Frontend Filtering UI Panel

## Status
- In Progress

## Story
**As a user,**
**I want** a filtering panel with controls for all core data points,
**so that** I can define my search criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A dedicated filter panel component is created in the React frontend.
2. The panel includes input fields or dropdowns for each core data point (name, city, star rating, NAICS code, etc.).
3. The state of the filter inputs is managed within the frontend application.
4. An "Apply Filters" button is present and clearly visible.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create a persistent Filter Panel component in `apps/frontend/src/` (AC: 1) [Source: front-end-spec.md#key-screen-layouts-main-dashboard]
  - [x] Use Mantine UI components for inputs, dropdowns, and buttons [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
  - [x] Add text input for business name [Source: prd.md#story-2-1-frontend-filtering-ui-panel]
  - [x] Add dropdowns/selects for city, star rating, NAICS code, etc. [Source: prd.md#story-2-1-frontend-filtering-ui-panel]
  - [x] Ensure all filter controls are accessible and keyboard-navigable [Source: front-end-spec.md#accessibility-requirements]
- [x] Manage filter state using Zustand or React state [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
- [x] Implement an "Apply Filters" button that triggers the filter action (AC: 4) [Source: prd.md#story-2-1-frontend-filtering-ui-panel]
- [x] Integrate the Filter Panel into the main dashboard layout [Source: front-end-spec.md#key-screen-layouts-main-dashboard]
- [x] Write unit/component tests for the Filter Panel [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- [x] Ensure responsive design for desktop and mobile [Source: front-end-spec.md#responsiveness-strategy]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- The business list/table is already implemented and fetches all businesses from `/api/businesses` [Source: stories/1.5-frontend-data-display.md#dev-notes]
- The shared `Business` type is defined in `packages/shared-types/index.ts` and should be used for filter field types [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]

### Data Models
- Use the `Business` interface for filterable fields: name, city, starRating, naicsCode, etc. [Source: architecture.md#data-models]
- Filter panel fields should match the available query parameters in the backend API [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]

### API Specifications
- The `/api/businesses` endpoint supports filtering by city, starRating, naicsCode, yearStarted, etc. via query parameters [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]
- The filter panel should prepare and pass these parameters to the API on filter submission

### Component Specifications
- The Filter Panel should be a persistent left-side panel (25-30% width on desktop) [Source: front-end-spec.md#key-screen-layouts-main-dashboard]
- Use Mantine UI components for all controls [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
- All controls must be accessible and support keyboard navigation [Source: front-end-spec.md#accessibility-requirements]
- The "Apply Filters" button should be clearly visible and styled as a primary action [Source: prd.md#story-2-1-frontend-filtering-ui-panel]

### File Locations
- Main component: `apps/frontend/src/FilterPanel.tsx`
- State management: `apps/frontend/src/` (Zustand store or React context)
- Tests: `apps/frontend/src/__tests__/FilterPanel.test.tsx`
- Shared types: `packages/shared-types/index.ts`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit/component tests for all filter controls and the Apply button [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes [Source: front-end-spec.md#accessibility-requirements]
- Responsive tests for desktop and mobile layouts [Source: front-end-spec.md#responsiveness-strategy]
- Use Vitest and React Testing Library [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- Must use the shared `Business` type for all filter field types [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]
- Must ensure accessibility and responsiveness [Source: front-end-spec.md#accessibility-requirements]
- Must use Mantine UI components [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]

## Testing
- Test file location: `apps/frontend/src/__tests__/FilterPanel.test.tsx`
- Test standards: Use Vitest and React Testing Library
- Testing frameworks and patterns: Arrange-Act-Assert, mock API responses
- Specific requirements: Test all filter controls, Apply button, accessibility, and responsiveness
